Currently only has basic support for amd64 linux.  AMD64 freebsd has some basic
stuff in src/freebsd and syscaller.d, but that's mostly just as a reference for
my future self of basic-but-hard-to-look-up things when I get around to
properly implementing it.  Future support for x86 and amd64 win32, and then
maybe more exotic things.  Works on DMD, LDC, and GDC.
